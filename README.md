# ParadocsTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.14.

## How to start it

To run an Angular project, start by ensuring that both Node.js and Angular CLI are installed on your system. Node.js can be downloaded from its official website, and Angular CLI can be installed globally using the command npm install -g @angular/cli. Once the tools are in place, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your Angular project is located. Before running the project, you'll need to install all necessary dependencies by executing npm install, which will pull in all the packages specified in the package.json file. After the dependencies are installed, you can launch the development server by typing ng serve in your terminal. This command will start the project and make it accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:4200. If you need to use a different port, you can specify it with the --port flag, like ng serve --port 4201. Once the server is running, simply open your browser and navigate to the specified URL to view and interact with your Angular application.
